# It's a website

This repository contains the content that I put on my personal website. The current iteration uses Vue and TailwindCSS for styling.

"But, does it really have to be an SPA" you might ask, to which the answer is, "Nope, absolutely not." Well, at least not at the moment. I am hoping that it will turn into a bit of a blog, and I want to be able to write posts without having to mess around with HTML and styling for each post. It seems simpler to make some JavaScript magic do it.
