      Look, I know that I said that there would be some kind of writing here.
      However, I have not really gotten to that part yet. This is all part of my
      plan for self-improvement and I am working towards a goal which includes
      creating more projects and writing about them. If you come back in a
      couple of weeks, I am sure there will be something here. Perhaps it will
      even be a kind of meta post describing building this very website, who
      knowsâ€½
